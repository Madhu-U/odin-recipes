    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup whole wheat flour</li>
      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>Â¾ cup hot water or as needed</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil or vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Mix whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, and salt in a large bowl. Use
        a wooden spoon to stir in water and oil. Mix until a soft, elastic dough
        forms and add more water, if needed. Knead dough on a lightly floured
        surface until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide dough into 10 equal portions, or less if you want larger
        chapatis. Roll each piece into a ball and let rest for a few minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Heat a lightly greased skillet over medium heat.</li>
      <li>
        Use a rolling pin to roll dough balls out on a lightly floured surface
        until very thin.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the skillet starts to smoke, place a chapati in it. Cook until
        bottom has brown spots, about 30 seconds, then flip and cook 30 seconds
        more. Repeat to cook remaining chapatis.
      </li>
